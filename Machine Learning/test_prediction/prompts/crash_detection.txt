Analyze the image, a frame from a road surveillance video, to detect and assess any car accident. Focus on clear visual indicators such as:

- **Vehicle Damage**: Dents, broken parts, open hoods, or misalignment.
- **Unusual Vehicle Positions**: Off-road, collisions, or abnormal angles.
- **Debris & Skid Marks**: Road obstacles, scattered parts, or visible tire marks.
- **Traffic Disruption**: Stalled vehicles, congestion, or people gathering.
- **Weather Impact**: Wet roads or low visibility affecting conditions.

### Output Format:
Provide a structured table summarizing the findings strictly based on visible evidence:

| Accident Severity (Details) | Vehicles Involved | Location Type | Likely Cause               |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Medium / High | Number of affected vehicles | (e.g., intersection, village road) | (e.g., collision, skidding, unclear) |

### Severity Levels:
- **Medium**: Minor damage, clustering of people/cars, open car hood , Unusual Vehicle Positions, Unusual people Positions , collisions.
- **High**: Severe damage, emergency response, road blockage.

Stick to observed evidence and avoid speculation.
